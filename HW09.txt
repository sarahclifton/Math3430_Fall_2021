Question 01) Recently we discussed floating point arithmetic, which has become
the standard way of representing numbers on a computer. One of the key aspects
of floating point numbers is that the gap between a number and it's floating
point representation increases with the magnitude of the number. 
This differs from what is called a "fixed
point" representation, where the gap is constant.

What is an advantage or disadvantage to using floating point instead of fixed
point?

The difference between the floating point and fixed-point numbers is that floating-point numbers have a gap between a number and its
floating-point representation increases with the magnitude of the number. A fixed-point number has a gap that is always constant. An
advantage for using a floating point rather than a fixed point is that it provides a very large range. Even though floating points
are good for when one needs to express numbers on a varying scale, a disadvantage is that it sacrifices precision to gain the range
of scale.
